4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible

### What to expect:
- Acknowledgment within 48 hours

## Security Considerations

- Local storage used for preferences only

### Dependencies

- Security audits using `npm audit`
- Minimal dependency footprint

### Deployment
- HTTPS enforced for all deployments
- Content Security Policy headers recommended
- Regular security scans of deployed instances
